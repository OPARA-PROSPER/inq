This document is a _functional specification_ (in other words, it documents
how the program works from an end-user perspective).
See [02-implementation.md](02-implementation.md) for a technical
specification (that is, how it is implemented).

*This document is incomplete.* It will take significant revisions before
this document can be considered complete.

## Overview

how_is is a command-line tool to quantify the state of a GitHub
repository, and suggest actionable tasks to improve maintenance. It uses
information from the issue tracker, the codebase itself, and third-party
APIs to accomplish this. The expected audience is project managers, or
people in similar roles, and software developers.
