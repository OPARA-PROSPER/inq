# Issue Management

This document explains what labels on a given issue mean, or to help you
choose labels for new/updated issues.

We use an issue tracker to organize and prioritize work by allowing users
to report bugs, request features or documentation, and start discussions.

---

## high priority

An issue that should be resolved as soon as possible.

## in progress

An issue which is currently being worked on. This should be added when
someone begins work on an issue.

## ready

An issue which is ready to be worked on. This should be removed when
someone begins work on an issue.

## size: large

An issue which is expected to take a large amount of effort to resolve.

## size: small

An issue which is expected to be relatively simple to resolve.

## type: bug report

A bug report.

## type: documentation

A request for additional or updated documentation.

## type: feature request

A request for a new feature to be added.

## type: question/discussion

A question or discussion. Issues with this label are likely to not have
any immediately-actionable tasks.

When any tasks do arise from an issue with this label, more specific
issues will likely be opened to replace it.

## type: refactoring

A request for a particular section of code to be refactored.

Including concrete suggestions for smaller areas will likely get these
issues resolved more quickly.

## type: tests

A request for new or improved tests addressing specific situations.
