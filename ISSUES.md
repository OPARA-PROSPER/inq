# Issue Management

The goal of issue management is to organize the work that needs to be
done when working on a project, by allowing users to report bugs,
request features or documentation, and start discussions.

To simplify that task, issues have _labels_. The purpose of labels is to
group issues in ways developers find useful. The obvious examples being
bug reports and feature requests.

This document is intended as a guide to help you understand what labels
on a given issue mean, or to help you choose labels for a new issue.

Labels on this repository are grouped, using the section before the
first colon in an issue name.

Issue groups:

* [(ungrouped)](#ungrouped)
* [category](#categories)
* [closed](#closed)
* [size](#size)
* [status](#status)
* [type](#type)

## (ungrouped)

### blocked

If an issue has this label, it _should_ (but, unfortunately, may not)
have an explanation of what other work needs to be done before it can be
worked on.

### duplicate

A duplicate issue.

### in progress

An issue which is currently being worked on. This should be added when
someone begins work on an issue.

### ready

An issue which is ready to be worked on. This should be removed when
someone begins work on an issue.

## categories

### category: export

Issues relating to exporting reports.

## size

### size: small

An issue which should, at least in theory, be relatively simple to
resolve.

### size: large

An issue which is expected to take a large amount of effort to resolve.

### size: here be dragons

An issue which is extremely difficult, possibly impossible, to determine
the actual difficulty of. It could be resolved quickly, or it could grow
significantly.

## type

### type: bug report

A bug report.

### type: feature request

A request for a new feature to be added.

### type: question
