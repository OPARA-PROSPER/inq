# Issue Management

This document is intended as a guide to help you understand what labels
on a given issue mean, or to help you choose labels for a new issue.

The goal of issue management is to organize the work that needs to be
done when working on a project, by allowing users to report bugs,
request features or documentation, and start discussions.

To simplify that task, issues have _labels_, to group issues in ways
that developers find useful.

---

## blocked

An issue which can't be worked on until something else is finished.

If an issue has this label, it _should_ have an explanation of what needs
to be finished before it can be worked on.

If it does not, feel free to leave a comment and ask for details.

## help wanted

An issue we'd like help with.

## high priority

An issue that should be resolved as soon as possible.

## in progress

An issue which is currently being worked on. This should be added when
someone begins work on an issue.

## ready

An issue which is ready to be worked on. This should be removed when
someone begins work on an issue.

## size: large

An issue which is expected to take a large amount of effort to resolve.

## size: small

It could be resolved quickly, or it could be impossible to do.

A bug report.

## type: feature request
